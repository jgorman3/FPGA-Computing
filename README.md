# FPGA-Computing
HDL programs written for the Mojo v3 Dev Board - Xilinx Spartan-6 XC6SLX9 FPGA and Terasic DE0 Nano Dev Board - Intel/Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE22 FPGA. Working with Embedded Micro's Verilog tutorial and ASIC World's tutorial to become more familiar with FPGA development. I plan on learning VHDL & SystemVerilog, as well.
